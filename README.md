# Eye_Disease_Detection
Our first customized Deep learning model. This repository was made to hold the contents of the ML/DL contest 2023.

## AIM:
Given an image we attempt to predict whether a person has either of the diseases or has a normal vision
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Cataract

## INPUTS RECEIVED:

We received close to 4000 retinal images pertaining to the above four categories.
The data was split into training and testing data set in the proportion 60% and 40% respectively
For each of the above two categories there are four folders with the respective image sets.

We have built a custom model and not implemented the transfer learning methodology successfully

## WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE BUILDING A MODEL?

-	The loaded dataset is rescaled to take values between 0 and 1
-	The target image size was fixed to (150,150) to preserve maximum features
-	Categorical Cross entropy was used for multiclass classification
-	An early stopping with patience parameter =5 was used to prevent waste of training time by monitoring loss value
-	Convolution 2D layer was added to suit the image inputs
-	The final layer is a dense layer with 4 neurons(referring to number of output categories)
-	All layers have an activation function of ‘relu’ while the last layer contains ‘SoftMax’ activation function
